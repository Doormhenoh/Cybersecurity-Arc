# Day 1 Journal – Setup & Target Familiarization

Date: 20/8/2025  
Target: Shopify  
Alias: 0x2Recon

# What I did today:
- Updated HackerOne profile and linked socials  
- Chose Shopify as my first public program  
- Reviewed scope, exclusions, and bounty tiers  
- Installed Burp Suite and configured Firefox proxy  
- Installed browser extensions: Wappalyzer, HackTools, Cookie Editor  
- Created a note-taking system and folder structure  
- Ran basic recon: whois, nslookup, crt.sh, subfinder  
- Analyzed subdomains and attempted payload injection

# What I learned:
- Subdomains reveal hidden services and expand the attack surface  
- Shopify’s infrastructure is heavily protected  
- Burp Suite setup is essential for traffic interception  
- Browser extensions streamline recon and payload testing

# Challenges faced:
- Bot protection blocked access to help pages and input forms  
- No clear injection points in initial requests

# Next steps:
- Use `httpx`, `gau`, and `hakrawler` for passive recon  
- Organize endpoints and parameters  
- Begin vulnerability mapping for Day.
